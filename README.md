# Hyperbolic AI Prompter fully hosted on ICP

**Hyperbolic AI Prompter** is an application in which the server and frontend is hosted on DFINITY (ICP) that leverages Hyperbolic's API for generating text, speech, and images. This project provides endpoints to create content using OpenAI-powered models for text generation, text-to-speech (TTS), and image generation with support for ControlNet and LoRA models.

## Features

- **Text Generation**: Users can input a prompt, and the system will generate a text response using a selected AI model.
- **Image Generation**: Users can input a description to generate an image based on that description with support for ControlNet and LoRA models.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Users can input text and receive a generated audio file (such as a voice reading the text).
- **Responsive Design**: The UI adapts seamlessly to both desktop and mobile devices for an optimal user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - React (for building the user interface)
  - Tailwind CSS (for styling)
- **Backend**:
  - Motoko
  - Image generation API (Using hyperbolic API)
  - Audio generation API (Using hyperbolic API)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (version >= 14.x)
- **npm** or **yarn** (for package management)
- **Git** (to clone the repository)
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AustinChris1/ICP-Hyperbolic.git
cd ICP-Hyperbolic
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background --clean

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
